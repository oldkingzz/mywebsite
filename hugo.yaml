    content: |-
      I am a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania pursuing an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics with a concentration in Mechatronics and Robotics.

      My passion lies in building intelligent robotic systems that bridge the gap between theoretical control algorithms and real-world applications. I have hands-on experience in ROS system architecture, embedded control, and autonomous navigation.

      As the founder and control leader of my university's Robocon team, I led 20 interdisciplinary members to develop a complete autonomous system from scratch, achieving high-precision SLAM navigation and real-time object detection.
